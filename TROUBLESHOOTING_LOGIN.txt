TROUBLESHOOTING: "Username atau password salah" ERROR

If you're getting "Username atau password salah" when trying to login with username "admin" and password "admin123", follow these steps:

STEP 1: CHECK DATABASE CONNECTION
1. Go to: http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/test_connection.php
2. Verify that the database connection is working

STEP 2: SETUP DATABASE (IF TABLES DON'T EXIST)
If the test_connection.php shows that tables don't exist:
1. Double-click on setup_database.bat
2. This will create all necessary tables and the admin user

STEP 3: DEBUG THE LOGIN PROCESS
1. Go to: http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/debug_login.php
2. Check if users exist in the database
3. Verify if the password verification is working correctly

STEP 4: TEST THE QUERY FUNCTION
1. Go to: http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/test_execute_query.php
2. Check if the executeQuery function is working properly

STEP 5: RESET THE ADMIN USER
1. Go to: http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/reset_admin_user.php
2. This will ensure the admin user exists with the correct password

STEP 6: TRY TO LOGIN AGAIN
1. Go to: http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/login.php
2. Enter username: admin
3. Enter password: admin123

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

1. Database connection failed:
   - Make sure MySQL service is running in XAMPP
   - Check that the database "sman6_db" exists

2. No users in database:
   - Run the setup_database.bat script to create all tables
   - Or run reset_admin_user.php to create just the admin user

3. Password verification failed:
   - The password hash in the database might be corrupted
   - Run reset_admin_user.php to fix this

4. Query execution issues:
   - The executeQuery function might not be working correctly
   - Check the error logs in XAMPP for more details

If none of these steps work, please check the Apache error logs in XAMPP for more detailed error messages.
