TROUBLESHOOTING LOGIN ISSUES:
   If you can't login with username "admin" and password "admin123":
   1. Check if the admin user exists:
      Go to: http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/check_admin_user.php
      
   2. Reset the admin user:
      Go to: http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/reset_admin_user.php

      http://localhost/SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20SMA%20NEGERI%206%20SURAKARTA/login.php

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get database connection errors, make sure MySQL is running in XAMPP
- If the page doesn't load, make sure Apache is running in XAMPP
- If login fails, make sure you ran the setup_database.bat script

For any issues, please check that both Apache and MySQL services are running in XAMPP Control Panel.
