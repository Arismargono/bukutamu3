USER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - SMA NEGERI 6 SURAKARTA

SUMMARY OF IMPLEMENTATION:

1. User Management Functionality:
   - A comprehensive user management system has been implemented in user_management.php
   - Features include:
     * View all users in a table format
     * Add new users with username, name, email, role, and password
     * Edit existing users (name, email, role, active status)
     * Delete users (with protection against self-deletion)
     * Change user passwords
     * Role-based access control (admin, guru, siswa)

2. Integration with Existing System:
   - The user management link has been added to the sidebar navigation of all main pages:
     * dashboard.php (already had the link)
     * siswa.php
     * guru.php
     * kelas.php
     * mata_pelajaran.php
     * nilai.php
     * administrasi.php

3. Database Structure:
   - The system uses a MySQL database with a 'users' table
   - Table fields include: id, username, password, nama_lengkap, email, role, is_active, last_login, created_at, updated_at

4. Security Features:
   - Passwords are hashed using PHP's password_hash() function
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Session-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (only admins can access user management)
   - CSRF protection

HOW TO ACCESS USER MANAGEMENT:

1. Start XAMPP Control Panel
2. Start Apache and MySQL services
3. Open your web browser
4. Go to: http://localhost/sman6/login.php
5. Login with username: admin and password: admin123
6. Once logged in, click on "Manajemen User" in the left sidebar

ALTERNATIVE ACCESS:
- You can also directly access: http://localhost/sman6/user_management.php (after logging in)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get database errors, run setup_database.php first: http://localhost/sman6/setup_database.php
- If login fails, check that the database is properly set up and contains the admin user

The user management system is now fully functional and integrated into the school information system.
